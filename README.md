- Compatible with NLP frameworks (Hugging Face, Transformers)

## Acknowledgments
Johar and a huge thanks to Prasanta Hembram for his extensive translation work on Santali transcription. His contributions provided the foundation for this tokenizer, making it possible to process Santali text more effectively. You can check out his translation works here (https://github.com/Prasanta-Hembram/Translation-work-list-for-Santali-language)

# A *Ready to use* santali tokenizer using the dataset provided by prasanta hembram has been uploaded to google drive and the link for the same is below 
* Drive = (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ac6YjdEReopEwI6wRUiPif6irH1KXz4V?usp=sharing)
* It has a vocab json file
* And a merges txt file
* both of them makes santali tokenizer which can be used for llm projects in santali
